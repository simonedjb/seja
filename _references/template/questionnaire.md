# TEMPLATE - PROJECT INSTANTIATION QUESTIONNAIRE

> **Questionnaire version:** 6
> **Last updated:** 2026-04-02 00:00 UTC
>
> **Purpose:** Answer these questions to generate all 9 `project/` reference files from the `template/` templates. An agent can read your completed answers and produce the full set of project-specific references.
>
> **How to use:**
> 1. Start with **Section 0 (`metacomm-message`)** (optional, but fills defaults) and **Section 1 (`basic-definitions`)** -- these 10 answers are enough to generate a minimal skeleton.
> 2. Optionally answer **Section 0 (`metacomm-message`)** first -- an agent will extract project name, description, and user type to suggest defaults throughout the questionnaire.
> 3. For technical questions, choose from the provided alternatives or write your own.
> 4. Write `N/A` or `Skip` for sections that don't apply to your stack.
> 5. Work through remaining sections at your own pace. Sections are grouped by tier (T1 first, then T2, then T3). Use slugs for stable cross-references across documents.
> 6. When done, give this file to an agent with the instruction: *"Instantiate all template/\* files into project/\* files using the answers in this questionnaire."*
>
> **Alternative:** For a faster workflow, use `/design --generate-spec` to create a pre-fillable spec file (see `template/design-spec.md`).

---

## Knowledge Tiers

> This questionnaire is organized into three tiers based on the expertise required. If you are a solo product designer, focus on **T1** and accept the recommended defaults for **T2** and **T3**. If you have a full team, customize all three tiers.

| Tier | Sections | Who Fills It | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **T1 -- Product & Design** | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Product designer (solo or with team) | What the product is, how it should feel, how it should look |
| **T2 -- Architecture** | 6, 7, 8 | Product designer with defaults OR software architect | Tech stack selection and architecture decisions |
| **T3 -- Engineering Standards** | 9, 10, 11 | Auto-generated from T2 OR engineering team | Testing, i18n, and security standards |

> **Solo designer?** Complete T1 sections fully. For T2, accept the recommended defaults (marked **Recommended** in option tables) or type `?` next to any answer to trigger an interactive discussion. T3 sections will be auto-generated from your T2 choices.

---

## Section Reference Table

> Stable slug identifiers for all sections. Slugs are stable identifiers for questionnaire sections; since SEJA 2.8.1 the standards targets are H2 sections within unified files (e.g., `ux-design-standards` populates `template/design-standards.md § UX patterns`, `backend-standards` populates `template/standards.md § Backend`). Use slugs for stable cross-references in plans and documentation; they are decoupled from file names.

| Slug | # | Title | Tier |
|------|---|-------|------|
| `metacomm-message` | 0 | Metacommunication Message | T1 |
| `basic-definitions` | 1 | Basic Definitions | T1 |
| `conceptual-design` | 2 | Conceptual Design | T1 |
| `ux-design-standards` | 3 | UX Design Standards | T1 |
| `graphic-ui-design-standards` | 4 | Graphic/UI Design Standards | T1 |
| `docs-templates` | 5 | Documentation Templates | T1 |
| `conventions` | 6 | Project Conventions | T2 |
| `frontend-standards` | 7 | Frontend Standards | T2 |
| `backend-standards` | 8 | Backend Standards | T2 |
| `testing-standards` | 9 | Testing Standards | T3 |
| `i18n-standards` | 10 | i18n Standards | T3 |
| `security-checklists` | 11 | Security Checklists | T3 |

---

<!-- T1: Product & Design -- fill first; solo designers can stop after this block -->

## Section 0 -- Metacommunication Message (`metacomm-message`) [T1]

> **What this is:** An optional 1-3 sentence message from you (the designer) speaking directly to your future users. Use "I" (designer) and "you" (user) -- never third-person. See `general/shared-definitions.md` for the phrasing rule.
>
> **Why answer this first:** An agent filling in this questionnaire will extract project description, target user type, and primary use case from your message, offering them as suggested defaults for later questions -- reducing the number of questions you need to answer from scratch.
>
> **Example:** "I know you are a busy researcher who needs to track your experiments across projects. Therefore, I have designed a lightweight experiment tracking platform that lets you log runs, compare results, and share findings with your team."

**0.1** Write your metacommunication message (optional):

Answer:

> *Agent extraction hints -- from this answer, an agent will suggest defaults for:*
>
> - *[basic-definitions] 1.1 -- project display name*
> - *[basic-definitions] 1.2 -- application description (1-2 sentences)*
> - *[conceptual-design] 2.1 -- what the platform does and who it is for*
> - *[conceptual-design] 2.10 -- target user community*

---

## Section 4 -- Graphic / UI Design Standards (`graphic-ui-design-standards`) [T1]

> Fills: `project/design-standards.md § Graphic / visual design` -- visual identity, color system, typography, spacing, iconography, and motion. This is a **T1 (Product & Design)** section -- product designers should complete this directly.
>
> **Minimal viable path:** Answer only 4.1-4.3 (two colors + one font). All other values will be generated using established design scales.

### Colors

**4.1** What are your brand colors? Provide hex values.
> *Minimum: primary and secondary. The agent will generate a full palette (light/dark variants, semantic colors) from these two inputs.*

| Token | Hex | Usage | Example |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| `primary` | | Main actions, headings, active states | `#2563eb` (blue) |
| `secondary` | | Secondary text, borders, icons | `#64748b` (slate) |
| `accent` (optional) | | Highlights, badges, special elements | `#f59e0b` (amber) |

> *Default: Primary `#2563eb`, Secondary `#64748b`. Rationale: blue is the most universally trusted color for digital products; slate provides neutral contrast without the coldness of pure gray. Example: GitHub, Stripe, and Linear all use blue primary palettes.*

**4.2** Will your application support dark mode?

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **No (light only)** | Half the design surface area; faster to ship | No dark mode | **Recommended** for MVP |
| **Yes** | User preference; reduces eye strain | Doubles design/testing surface | Good for consumer products |
| **Later** | Ship light first; plan for dark | Must use semantic tokens from day one | Good compromise |

Answer:

### Typography

**4.3** What is your primary UI font?
> *The agent will generate a full typography scale (7 sizes from xs to 3xl) using the Major Third ratio (1.250) from this font choice.*

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **System font stack** | 0ms load time, matches host OS, no FOIT | Less brand differentiation | **Recommended** unless brand requires custom font |
| **Inter** | Designed for screens, excellent readability, free | Requires font download (~100KB) | Good for products needing brand identity |
| **Custom font** | Maximum brand differentiation | Download cost, FOIT/FOUT risk, licensing | Only if brand guidelines require it |

Answer:

**4.4** What typography scale do you prefer?

| Option | Ratio | Best For | Example |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Minor Third** | 1.200 | Compact UIs, data-dense apps | Smaller size jumps between headings |
| **Major Third** | 1.250 | Most applications | Balanced hierarchy, clear distinction |
| **Perfect Fourth** | 1.333 | Editorial, marketing, content-heavy | Dramatic size differences |

> *Default: Major Third (1.250). Rationale: clear visual hierarchy without excessive size jumps; works for both data-heavy and content-oriented apps. Example: Tailwind CSS uses a similar progression.*

Answer:

### Spacing & Layout

**4.5** What is your base spacing unit?

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **8px** | Divides cleanly (4px, 2px); aligns with Material Design, Apple HIG | Slightly larger minimum gaps | **Recommended** for most projects |
| **4px** | Finer control, tighter spacing | Requires more skill to use well | Good for data-dense UIs |

Answer:

### Iconography

**4.6** Which icon set will you use?

| Option | Style | Icons | License | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **Lucide** | Outlined, 24px | 1500+ | ISC (free) | Clean, consistent, active community | Outline-only | **Recommended** for most projects |
| **Heroicons** | Outlined + Solid | 300+ | MIT (free) | Tailwind team, two variants | Smaller set | Good with Tailwind |
| **Phosphor** | 6 weights | 7000+ | MIT (free) | Most versatile, huge set | Can be overwhelming | Good for complex apps |
| **Material Symbols** | Variable weight | 2500+ | Apache 2.0 | Largest set, Google-maintained | Can feel generic | Good for Material Design |

Answer:

### Component Visual Style

**4.7** What border radius style do you prefer?

| Option | Value | Best For | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Sharp** | 0-2px | Data-dense UIs, enterprise tools | Professional, minimal |
| **Soft** | 4-8px | Most applications | **Recommended** -- balanced, modern |
| **Round** | 12-16px | Consumer-facing, friendly products | Casual, approachable |
| **Pill** | 9999px | Tags, badges, specific elements | Usually combined with another style |

Answer:

**4.8** What shadow style do you prefer?

| Option | Best For | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|------|------|----------------|
| **Flat** | Minimalist designs | Clean, modern | No depth cues | Good for border-based designs |
| **Subtle** | Most applications | Depth without heaviness | May need adjustment for dark mode | **Recommended** for most apps |
| **Elevated** | Material-inspired designs | Clear depth hierarchy | Can feel heavy | Good for layered UIs |

Answer:

### Motion

**4.9** What level of motion/animation do you want?

| Option | Best For | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|------|------|----------------|
| **None** | Accessibility-first, enterprise tools | Simplest, fastest | No transition feedback | Only for strictly functional UIs |
| **Subtle** | Most applications | Functional feedback, professional | Requires consistent implementation | **Recommended** for most apps |
| **Expressive** | Consumer products, onboarding | Delightful, memorable | Can be distracting; more work | Good for consumer-facing products |

Answer: (list selected templates, or "defaults" for recommended only, or "skip" for none)

**5.2** Does your application have user-facing screens that need contextual help?
> *If yes, the contextual help template will include i18n-ready structure for per-screen help pages following the proven "What can I do? / How to do it? / How to verify?" pattern.*

Answer: (yes / no)

**5.3** Do you want to track architecture decisions as ADRs?
> *Architecture Decision Records capture the "why" behind significant decisions (framework choices, design patterns, trade-offs). They prevent future developers from undoing decisions without understanding the context.*

Answer: (yes / no)

### Framework Choices

**8.1** Which backend framework?

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Flask** | Lightweight, flexible, easy to learn, large ecosystem | No built-in ORM/auth/admin, more manual setup | **Recommended** for small-to-medium APIs |
| **Django** | Batteries-included (ORM, admin, auth, migrations), mature | Heavier, more opinionated, monolithic | Good for data-heavy apps needing admin UI |
| **FastAPI** | Async, auto-generated docs, Pydantic validation, modern Python | Younger ecosystem, async complexity | Good for high-throughput APIs or microservices |
| **Express/NestJS** | JavaScript/TypeScript fullstack, large ecosystem | Node.js event loop quirks, callback patterns (Express) | Good for TypeScript fullstack teams |

Answer:

**8.2** Which ORM / database layer?

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **SQLAlchemy** | Most powerful Python ORM, flexible, supports raw SQL | Complex, steeper learning curve | **Recommended** for Flask or FastAPI |
| **Django ORM** | Integrated with Django, simple, great migrations | Django-only, less flexible for complex queries | Use with Django |
| **Prisma** | Type-safe, great DX, auto-generated client | Node.js only, less mature for complex queries | Use with Express/NestJS |
| **TypeORM / Drizzle** | TypeScript-native, decorators or schema-based | TypeORM has known issues at scale; Drizzle is newer | Use with NestJS |

Answer:

**8.3** Which database?

| **Pydantic** | Built into FastAPI, Python type hints, fast | FastAPI-centric, less flexible for complex nesting | Use with FastAPI |
| **Django Forms / Serializers** | Integrated, DRF serializers are powerful | Django-only | Use with Django/DRF |
| **Zod / Joi** | TypeScript/JavaScript-native, composable | Node.js only | Use with Express/NestJS |

Answer:

**8.6** Which authentication approach?

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **JWT (HttpOnly cookies)** | Stateless, scalable, secure cookie storage | Token revocation requires blocklist, cookie setup complexity | **Recommended** for SPAs with same-origin API |
| **JWT (localStorage)** | Simple frontend implementation | XSS-vulnerable, tokens accessible to JavaScript | Not recommended for production |
| **Session-based** | Simple, built into most frameworks, easy revocation | Server-side storage, scaling requires session store | Good for traditional server-rendered apps |
| **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect** | Delegated auth, social login, enterprise SSO | Complex setup, third-party dependency | Good when integrating with identity providers |

Answer:

**8.7** What JWT token expiry times?
> *Fills `{{access_token_expiry}}`, `{{refresh_token_expiry}}`.*

## Final Step -- Metacommunication Message (if not provided in Section 0)

> **When this applies:** Only when the user did not provide a metacommunication message -- neither in Section 0 (`metacomm-message`) nor at `/design` invocation (e.g., as part of the initial prompt/brief). If a metacomm message was supplied at invocation, the agent reuses it verbatim as the Section 0.1 answer and skips this Final Step. Otherwise, this step is always the last item asked, regardless of whether the user skipped other sections.
>
> **What the agent does:** Using the answers (or assumed defaults) from all previous sections, the agent composes a recommended metacommunication message -- a 1-3 sentence message from the designer (I) speaking directly to the user (you), describing who the user is, what the designer has designed for them, and why (see `general/shared-definitions.md` for the full definition and phrasing rule).
>
> **Interaction:** The agent presents the recommended message and asks the user to:
>
> - **Accept** -- the message is recorded as-is. The agent appends a note: *"Generated by the design agent based on specifications defined in the design session on \<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC\>."*
> - **Edit** -- the user modifies the message; the agent records the edited version verbatim (per the verbatim rule in `general/shared-definitions.md`). No generation note is appended.
> - **Reject and skip** -- no metacommunication message is recorded; the field is left blank.
>
> *Feeds `project/product-design-as-intended.md`. Must follow the phrasing rule in `general/shared-definitions.md` -- always "I" (designer) and "you" (user), never third-person.*

## Version History

> This section tracks changes to the questionnaire format. When a spec file's `version` field differs from the current `questionnaire_version`, the agent uses this history to identify new, changed, or removed fields and offer migration.

| Version | Date       | Changes                                                                                                                      |
|---------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 2026-03-25 00:00 UTC | Initial versioned release. Sections 0-7 with all fields. Companion spec file format (template/design-spec.md) introduced |
| 2       | 2026-03-29 00:00 UTC | Added Knowledge Tiers preamble (T1/T2/T3). Added questions 0.3 (project mode, moved early for directory-structure routing) and 0.10 (team composition) to Section 0. Renumbered 0.3-0.8 to 0.4-0.9. Added brownfield-only questions 2.13-2.17 to Section 2. Added Section 8 (UX Design Standards, 9 questions). Added Section 9 (Graphic/UI Design Standards, 9 questions). Updated post-questionnaire checklist. Total project files generated: 7 to 9. |
| 3       | 2026-04-01 00:00 UTC | Added Section 10 (Documentation Templates, 3 questions) to T1 tier. Documentation templates in `template/docs/` can now be instantiated during project setup. Updated post-questionnaire checklist. |
| 4       | 2026-04-02 00:00 UTC | Added Section M (Metacommunication Message) as first T1 section. Added Section Reference Table with slugs. Annotated all section headers with slug identifiers and tier tags. Reordered sections by tier (T1: M, 0, 2, 8, 9, 10; T2: 1, 3, 4; T3: 5, 6, 7). Added HTML tier block dividers. Updated How to use block. T1 tier now includes section M. |
| 5       | 2026-04-02 00:00 UTC | Moved metacommunication message fallback from question 2.10 to a new "Final Step" section after all questionnaire sections. When the user did not provide a message in Section M, the agent now generates a recommended metacommunication message inferred from previous answers, allowing the user to accept, edit, or reject-and-skip. Accepted generated messages are annotated with a generation note. Renumbered 2.11-2.17 to 2.10-2.16. |
| 6       | 2026-04-02 00:00 UTC | Renumbered all sections sequentially by tier order: M->0, 0->1 (renamed "Basic Definitions", slug `quick-start`->`basic-definitions`), 2->2, 8->3, 9->4, 10->5, 1->6, 3->7, 4->8, 5->9, 6->10, 7->11. All question sub-numbers updated to match new section prefixes. Post-Questionnaire Checklist now uses slug-based references. External references (SKILL.md) migrated from section numbers to slugs. |
