## Domain
<!-- Describe your conceptual design here. This section is free-form.
     You may provide a free-form metacommunication message.
     Otherwise, include:
     - What your platform does, who it's for, what problem it solves
     - Design philosophy or methodology (if any)
     - Main entities and their hierarchy (e.g., Organization > Project > Task > Comment)
     - For each entity: what it represents, visibility rules, ownership, soft delete (yes/no)
     - Domain-specific concepts (workflows, scoring, annotations, approval chains)
     - Permission model: system-level roles and resource-level access
     - Content authoring: how authorship is tracked, mentions/notifications
     - Target user community: language, geography, domain expertise
     - Validation constants: field limits with domain rationale

     You can use prose, bullet lists, tables, or any Markdown format.
     The agent will use this to populate project/conceptual-design-as-is.md
     and project/conceptual-design-to-be.md. -->

- navigation:

<!-- Form validation: inline-validation | on-submit | progressive
     inline-validation: Immediate feedback on blur, fewer submission errors (RECOMMENDED)
     on-submit: Less noise during entry, batch error display
     progressive: Step-by-step, reduces cognitive load for complex forms
     Default: inline-validation. Rationale: reduces submission errors by ~22% (Baymard, 2024). -->
- form_pattern:

<!-- Empty state strategy: action-prompt | illustration | text-only
     action-prompt: Guides first action for primary entities (RECOMMENDED for primary)
     illustration: Friendly, reduces anxiety for secondary views
     text-only: Lightweight for minor sections
     Default: action-prompt. Rationale: first-use experience drives retention. -->
- empty_states:

<!-- Error display: toast | inline | full-page
     toast: Non-blocking, auto-dismiss, good for transient errors

<!-- All other values will be derived from established design scales. -->

<!-- Brand colors: hex values.
     Example: #2563eb (blue), #64748b (slate)
     Default: primary=#2563eb, secondary=#64748b. Rationale: blue is universally trusted; slate provides neutral contrast. -->
- primary_color:
- secondary_color:
- accent_color:

<!-- Fonts: provide font family names.
     system: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif (RECOMMENDED -- 0ms load)

     perfect-fourth: Dramatic, editorial/marketing
     Default: major-third. Rationale: clear hierarchy without excessive size jumps. -->
- type_scale:

<!-- Base spacing unit: 4px | 8px
     8px: Divides cleanly (4px, 2px), aligns with Material Design and Apple HIG (RECOMMENDED)
     4px: Finer control for data-dense UIs
     Default: 8px. Rationale: most widely adopted grid system. -->
- spacing_unit:

<!-- Border radius style: sharp (0-2px) | soft (4-8px) | round (12-16px) | pill (9999px)

- shadow_style:

<!-- Motion level: none | subtle | expressive
     none: Instant state changes, accessibility-first
     subtle: Micro-animations for feedback and transitions (RECOMMENDED)
     expressive: Rich animations for delight and storytelling
     Default: subtle. Rationale: functional feedback without distraction; respects prefers-reduced-motion. -->
- motion:

<!-- Icon set: lucide | heroicons | phosphor | material-symbols
     lucide: Clean, 1500+ icons, active community, ISC license (RECOMMENDED)
     heroicons: Tailwind team, outline + solid, 300+ icons
     phosphor: 6 weights, 7000+ icons, most versatile
     material-symbols: Largest set (2500+), variable font
     Default: lucide. Rationale: best balance of quality, consistency, and availability. -->
- icon_set:

<!-- Dark mode: yes | no | later
     no: Ship light mode first, half the design surface (RECOMMENDED for MVP)
     yes: User preference, reduces eye strain, doubles design work
     later: Ship light first but use semantic tokens from day one
     Default: no. Rationale: ship faster; add dark mode as enhancement. -->
