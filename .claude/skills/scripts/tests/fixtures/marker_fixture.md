# Test Fixture -- Human (markers)

<!-- This file exists only for the test suite of apply_marker.py and check_human_markers_only.py.
     It is classified Human (markers) via .claude/skills/scripts/human_markers_registry.py so the
     scripts have a non-empty allowlist to exercise against. Do not modify by hand during normal
     framework work -- tests will rewrite it in a tmp_path copy per test.
