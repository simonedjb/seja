# TEMPLATE -- AS-CODED

<!-- maintained-by: Agent (post-skill); Agent classification since SEJA 2.8.4 -->

> **How to use this template:** Copy this file to `project/product-design-as-coded.md`. It records the implementation state (as-coded) in three domain sections: Conceptual Design, Metacommunication, and Journey Maps. This unified file replaces the three separate as-is files (conceptual-design-as-is, metacomm-as-is, journey-maps-as-is) that existed prior to SEJA 2.8.4. See the framework CHANGELOG for the migration rationale (source: advisory-000264 Phase 2 E).
>
> **Classification**: `Agent` -- this file is written by post-skill step 2 after each plan execution. Designers read the file to understand what the codebase currently implements; post-skill mirrors the target product-design-as-intended.md structure into the three sections here as code ships.
>
> **Section boundary discipline**: post-skill writes target one H2 domain section at a time. The `check_section_boundary_writes.py` validator at preflight step 6c rejects any contiguous write region that spans two or more H2 sections. This catches the class of bug where a buggy Edit call accidentally modifies an adjacent section. The validator uses git-diff against the prior commit and allows arbitrary edits WITHIN a section.
>
> **Related files:**
> - `project/product-design-as-intended.md` -- target design intent, Human (markers) classification (since SEJA 2.8.3)
> - `project/product-design-changelog.md` -- changelog for conceptual-design changes, kept separate (Phase 3 F will embed conditionally)

## Conceptual Design

<!-- Unified conceptual design (§1-§10 as H3+ subsections) -->

### 1. Platform Purpose

> Describe in 2-3 paragraphs: What does this platform do? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?

#### Design Philosophy

> If the platform follows a specific design philosophy or methodology, document it here. This helps ensure all design decisions align with the platform's core intent.

### 2. Entity Hierarchy

> Map out the primary entities and their relationships. Use an ASCII tree to show containment/hierarchy:

```
{{TopLevelEntity}}
└── {{ChildEntity}}
    └── {{GrandchildEntity}}
        └── {{LeafEntity}}
```

#### {{TopLevelEntity}}

> For each entity, document:
> - What it represents in the domain
> - Visibility/access rules
> - Ownership model
> - Uniqueness constraints
> - Soft delete behavior (if applicable)

#### {{ChildEntity}}

> - Scope: Belongs to exactly one {{TopLevelEntity}}
> - Key domain rules

#### {{LeafEntity}}

> - The atomic unit of content
> - Threading/nesting behavior (if applicable)
> - Content format (plain text, rich text, etc.)
> - Attachment support (if applicable)

### 3. Domain-Specific Concepts

> Document any domain-specific concepts that are unique to this application and not covered by standard CRUD patterns. For each concept:
> - What it is
> - Why it exists
> - How it relates to other entities
> - Any multilingual or localization requirements

### 4. Permission Model

> Define the permission levels for your application. Most applications have at least two levels: system-wide roles and resource-level access.

#### System-Level Roles

| Role | Level | Capabilities |
|------|-------|-------------|
| {{Role1}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |
| {{Role2}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |
| {{Role3}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |

#### Resource-Level Access

> If your application has resource-scoped permissions (e.g., per-group, per-project, per-organization), define them here:

| Access Level | Level | Capabilities |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| {{Level1}} | {{value}} | {{description}} |
| {{Level2}} | {{value}} | {{description}} |

> **Rationale:** Explain why these specific permission levels exist and how they map to real-world user roles.

### 5. Content Authoring & Attribution

> If your application supports content creation, document:
> - How authorship is tracked
> - Whether content can be attributed to non-system users
> - Mention/notification systems
> - Import/export attribution rules

### 6. Content Import & Export

> If applicable, document supported formats:

#### Import Formats

| Format | Source | Features |
|--------|--------|----------|
| {{format}} | {{source}} | {{features}} |

#### Export Formats

| Format | Output | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| {{format}} | {{output}} | {{use_case}} |

### 7. User Community & Localization

#### Target Community

> Describe the primary user base: language, geography, domain expertise.

#### Localization Design

| Aspect | Primary | Secondary |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| UI default language | {{PRIMARY_LOCALE}} | {{SECONDARY_LOCALE}} |
| Backend error default | {{BACKEND_DEFAULT}} | — |

> Explain why these locale choices were made.

### 8. User Experience Patterns (Domain-Driven)

> Document the key UX patterns that are driven by domain requirements rather than generic UI conventions. For each pattern:
> - What the user sees/does
> - Why this pattern was chosen (domain rationale)
> - Any metacommunication intent

### 9. Administrative Domain

#### Activity Logging

> What operations are logged? What format?

#### Backup & Restore

> Any domain-specific backup/restore requirements?

#### Terms & Conditions

> Any domain-specific legal/compliance requirements?

### 10. Validation Constants (Domain)

> Domain-driven validation limits. These should reflect real-world constraints, not arbitrary technical limits.

| Constant | Value | Domain Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| {{field}} length | {{min}}–{{max}} chars | {{why}} |

> **Note:** These constants must be kept in sync between backend and frontend. See `project/security-checklists.md` Quick Reference for the technical mapping.

## Metacommunication

<!-- Unified metacommunication (§1-§5 as H3+ subsections) -->

### 1. Global Metacommunication Summary

> Summarize the current designer-to-user message as actually implemented in the system. **Phrasing: use "I" as the designer and "you" as the user — never third-person or passive voice (see `general/shared-definitions.md` § Phrasing rule).** Use the semiotic engineering frame: "Here is my understanding of who you are, what I've learned you want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. This is the system that I have therefore designed for you, and this is the way you can or should use it in order to fulfill a range of purposes that fall within this vision."

### Delta from Established

<!-- Populate this section when `project/ux-research-results.md §5` contains JM-E-NNN entries
     (i.e., the project has conducted formal journey research and documented it there).
     This delta compares the current implementation against empirical research findings --
     a qualitatively different signal from the to-be delta above (research-vs-reality, not intent-vs-reality).
     Leave this section empty or omit it when no such entries are present. -->
