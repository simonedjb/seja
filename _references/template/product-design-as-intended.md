# TEMPLATE -- DESIGN INTENT

<!-- maintained-by: human (designer); Human (markers) classification since SEJA 2.8.3 -->

> **How to use this template:** Copy this file to `project/product-design-as-intended.md`. This unified file records working design intent (§0-§17), validated decisions with preserved rationale (`## Decisions` in ADR shape), and a chronological changelog of marker flips and decision additions (`## CHANGELOG`). Replaces the two separate design-intent-to-be.md and design-intent-established.md files that existed prior to SEJA 2.8.3. See the framework CHANGELOG for the migration rationale (source: advisory-000264 Phase 2 D / plan-000268).
>
> **Classification**: `Human (markers)` -- prose (intent, entity hierarchies, permission models, metacomm intentions, journey maps, decision rationales) is human-authored only. Agents may write `STATUS` markers on §1-§17 sections, §15 JM-TB-NNN journey entries, and `### D-NNN:` Decision entries via `apply_marker.py` after AskUserQuestion confirmation. Agents may also append lines to the `## CHANGELOG` section. Prose writes to `project/product-design-as-intended.md` are rejected by `check_human_markers_only.py` during post-skill step 6c.
>
> **Stable IDs**: Decision entries use `D-NNN` (e.g., `D-001`); journey map entries in §15 use `JM-TB-NNN`; requirement markers preserved from the pre-merge template use the existing REQ-TYPE-NNN convention (REQ-ENT, REQ-PERM, REQ-UX, REQ-MC, REQ-JM, REQ-I18N, REQ-DELTA). D-NNN and REQ-TYPE-NNN are orthogonal: Decisions record *why* something was chosen; REQs identify *what* must exist. A single section can carry both.
>
> **STATUS state machine** (for to-be items and Decision entries): `proposed -> implemented -> established -> superseded`. The `apply_marker.py` helper validates transitions. Legacy uppercase `STATUS: IMPLEMENTED` markers from pre-2.8.3 files remain valid and are grandfathered in; new markers should use the lowercase form.
>
> **Append-only sections**: `## Decisions` and `## CHANGELOG` are enforced append-only by `check_changelog_append_only.py` (post-skill step 6c). The `## Decisions` section uses the prose-only rule: marker lines matching `ALLOWED_MARKERS` are filtered out before the prefix-preserving check, so apply_marker.py may insert STATUS markers above existing `### D-NNN:` headings without triggering a middle-insertion violation. The `## CHANGELOG` section uses the strict rule: historical lines never change.
>
> **Promotion workflow**: items with `STATUS: implemented` are candidates for promotion to `STATUS: established` via `/explain spec-drift --promote`. The workflow splits into Phase 3a (agent writes a prose proposal report to `_output/promote-proposals/`) and Phase 3b (`/explain spec-drift --promote --apply-markers plan-NNNNNN` runs per-item AskUserQuestion + marker flip). The designer copies the proposal prose into `## Decisions` between the two phases.

## 0. Planned Changes

> Summarize the high-level changes planned for the next version of the conceptual design.

| Target Version | Change Summary | Motivation / Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| {{vN}} | {{summary}} | {{why}} |

---

## 1. Platform Purpose

> Describe in 2-3 paragraphs: What does this platform do? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?

### Design Philosophy

> If the platform follows a specific design philosophy or methodology, document it here. This helps ensure all design decisions align with the platform's core intent.

---

## 2. Entity Hierarchy

> Map out the primary entities and their relationships. Use an ASCII tree to show containment/hierarchy:

```
{{TopLevelEntity}}
└── {{ChildEntity}}
    └── {{GrandchildEntity}}
        └── {{LeafEntity}}
```

<!-- REQ-ENT-001 -->
### {{TopLevelEntity}}

> For each entity, document:
> - What it represents in the domain
> - Visibility/access rules
> - Ownership model
> - Uniqueness constraints
> - Soft delete behavior (if applicable)

### {{ChildEntity}}

> - Scope: Belongs to exactly one {{TopLevelEntity}}
> - Key domain rules

### {{LeafEntity}}

> - The atomic unit of content
> - Threading/nesting behavior (if applicable)
> - Content format (plain text, rich text, etc.)
> - Attachment support (if applicable)

---

## 3. Domain-Specific Concepts

> Document any domain-specific concepts that are unique to this application and not covered by standard CRUD patterns. For each concept:
> - What it is
> - Why it exists
> - How it relates to other entities
> - Any multilingual or localization requirements

---

## 4. Permission Model

> Define the permission levels for your application. Most applications have at least two levels: system-wide roles and resource-level access.

### System-Level Roles

| Role | Level | Capabilities |
|------|-------|-------------|
<!-- REQ-PERM-001 -->
| {{Role1}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |
| {{Role2}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |
| {{Role3}} | {{level}} | {{description}} |

### Resource-Level Access

> If your application has resource-scoped permissions (e.g., per-group, per-project, per-organization), define them here:

| Access Level | Level | Capabilities |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| {{Level1}} | {{value}} | {{description}} |
| {{Level2}} | {{value}} | {{description}} |

> **Rationale:** Explain why these specific permission levels exist and how they map to real-world user roles.

---

## 5. Content Authoring & Attribution

> If your application supports content creation, document:
> - How authorship is tracked
> - Whether content can be attributed to non-system users
> - Mention/notification systems
> - Import/export attribution rules

---

## 6. Content Import & Export

> If applicable, document supported formats:

### Import Formats

| Format | Source | Features |
|--------|--------|----------|
| {{format}} | {{source}} | {{features}} |

### Export Formats

| Format | Output | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| {{format}} | {{output}} | {{use_case}} |

---

## 7. User Community & Localization

### Target Community

> Describe the primary user base: language, geography, domain expertise.

### Localization Design

| Aspect | Primary | Secondary |
|--------|---------|-----------|
<!-- REQ-I18N-001 -->
| UI default language | {{PRIMARY_LOCALE}} | {{SECONDARY_LOCALE}} |
| Backend error default | {{BACKEND_DEFAULT}} | -- |

> Explain why these locale choices were made.

---

## 8. User Experience Patterns (Domain-Driven)

> Document the key UX patterns that are driven by domain requirements rather than generic UI conventions. For each pattern:
> - What the user sees/does
> - Why this pattern was chosen (domain rationale)
> - Any metacommunication intent

<!-- REQ-UX-001 -->

---

## 9. Administrative Domain

### Activity Logging

> What operations are logged? What format?

### Backup & Restore

> Any domain-specific backup/restore requirements?

### Terms & Conditions

> Any domain-specific legal/compliance requirements?

---

## 10. Validation Constants (Domain)

> Domain-driven validation limits. These should reflect real-world constraints, not arbitrary technical limits.

| Constant | Value | Domain Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
<!-- REQ-VAL-001 -->
| {{field}} length | {{min}}--{{max}} chars | {{why}} |

> **Note:** These constants must be kept in sync between backend and frontend. See `project/security-checklists.md` Quick Reference for the technical mapping.

---

# Part II -- Metacommunication

> This part captures the designer's intent -- what the system should communicate to users. For the definition of metacommunication message, see `general/shared-definitions.md`.

## 11. Global Metacommunication Vision

> Write the full designer-to-user message as you intend it. **Phrasing: use "I" as the designer and "you" as the user -- never third-person or passive voice (see `general/shared-definitions.md` Phrasing rule).** Use the semiotic engineering frame: "Here is my understanding of who you are, what I've learned you want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. This is the system that I have therefore designed for you, and this is the way you can or should use it in order to fulfill a range of purposes that fall within this vision."

## 13. Solution Representations

> Describe how the user achieves their goals *with* the designed system. These are design decisions -- they reference personas and goals from user research (`project/ux-research-results.md`) and optionally reference problem scenarios. Choose the representation that best fits your team's workflow -- solution scenarios (narrative), user stories (role-goal-benefit), or both.

### Option A: Solution Scenarios

> Step-by-step narratives of the user's experience with the system. Best for complex flows where the sequence of interactions, emotions, and system responses matters.

#### {{SS-001}}: {{Solution Scenario Title}}

- **Persona:** {{PersonaName}} (from user research)
- **Goals:** {{G-001}}, {{G-002}} (from user research)
- **Problem Scenario:** {{PS-001}} (from user research, optional)
- **Setting:** {{where and when the user uses the system}}
- **Design Rationale:** {{optional -- why this solution approach was chosen over alternatives}}

{{2-3 paragraphs describing how the user achieves their goal with the system. Walk through the interaction step by step. What does the user see, do, and feel? How does the system respond? Write from the user's perspective.}}

### Option B: User Stories

> Concise role-goal-benefit statements. Best for backlog management, sprint planning, and when the interaction details are deferred to design/implementation.

#### {{US-001}}: {{User Story Title}}

- **Story:** As {{PersonaName}}, I want to {{action}} so that {{benefit}}.
- **Goals:** {{G-001}}, {{G-002}} (from user research)
- **Problem Scenario:** {{PS-001}} (from user research, optional)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - {{criterion 1}}
  - {{criterion 2}}
  - {{criterion 3}}
- **Design Rationale:** {{optional -- why this solution approach was chosen over alternatives}}

> **Note:** Solution scenarios and user stories are complementary. A user story can reference a solution scenario for the detailed interaction narrative, and a solution scenario can be decomposed into user stories for implementation tracking. Use whichever combination serves your project.

---

## 14. Per-Feature Metacommunication Intentions

> For each feature or interaction flow, document what the designer intends the system to communicate to the user. **Each intent must be phrased as "I ... for you / because you ..." -- see `general/shared-definitions.md` Phrasing rule.**

| Feature / Flow | Designer Intent | Priority | Source | Last Synced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
<!-- REQ-MC-001 -->
| {{feature}} | {{intent}} | {{P0 / P1 / P2}} | {{human / agent (spec-drift) / agent (metacomm)}} | {{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}} |

---

## 15. Designed User Journeys

> Document the intended step-by-step user experience for key flows. These are design
> decisions -- how you want users to experience the system.
>
> **One-directional flow:** Research findings in `project/ux-research-results.md §5`
> inform this section. This section does NOT flow back into the research file.
>
> **Related files:**
>
> - `project/ux-research-results.md §5` -- discovered journeys (upstream evidence)
> - `project/product-design-as-coded.md § Journey Maps` -- implemented journeys (agent-maintained)
> - §13 Solution Representations (above) -- narrative counterparts
>
> **Lifecycle:** When a journey in this section has been implemented by a plan, mark it with
> `<!-- STATUS: IMPLEMENTED | plan-NNNNNN | YYYY-MM-DD -->`. When promoting to established,
> use `<!-- ESTABLISHED: ... -->` or run `/explain spec-drift --promote`.

---

<!-- REQ-JM-001 -->
### JM-TB-001: {{Journey Title}}

- **Persona:** {{PersonaName}} (from `project/ux-research-results.md §1`)
- **Solution Scenario:** {{SS-001}} (from §13 above, optional)
- **Informed by:** {{JM-E-NNN}} (ux-research-results.md §5, optional -- link to discovered journey if applicable)
- **Goal:** {{what the user wants to achieve}}
- **Pre-conditions:** {{what must be true before the journey starts}}

#### Steps

| # | Action | Touchpoint | User Emotion | Pain Point | Opportunity |
| - | ------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 | {{what the user does}} | {{where they interact}} | {{how they feel}} | {{friction or frustration}} | {{design improvement}} |
| 2 | {{action}} | {{touchpoint}} | {{emotion}} | {{pain point}} | {{opportunity}} |
| 3 | {{action}} | {{touchpoint}} | {{emotion}} | {{pain point}} | {{opportunity}} |

#### Post-conditions / Outcomes

{{What is true after the journey completes. What has the user achieved?}}

#### Mermaid Diagram (optional)

> Use the Mermaid `journey` chart type for visual representation.

```mermaid
journey
    title {{Journey Title}}
    section {{Phase 1}}
        {{Action 1}}: {{satisfaction 1-5}}: {{Actor}}
        {{Action 2}}: {{satisfaction 1-5}}: {{Actor}}
    section {{Phase 2}}
        {{Action 3}}: {{satisfaction 1-5}}: {{Actor}}
        {{Action 4}}: {{satisfaction 1-5}}: {{Actor}}
```

> Satisfaction scores: 1 = frustrated, 3 = neutral, 5 = delighted.

## Decisions

> Validated decisions with preserved rationale, in Nygard ADR shape. Each entry is a `### D-NNN:` heading with a `STATUS` marker on the line immediately above, followed by Context / Decision / Consequences / optional Supersedes fields.
>
> **Lifecycle**: Decisions start as `STATUS: proposed` when the designer drafts them. They advance to `implemented` when the corresponding work ships (post-skill step 2e proposes the marker flip via AskUserQuestion). They advance to `established` via `/explain spec-drift --promote` Phase 3b after the designer has copied the proposal prose into the entry. They advance to `superseded` only when a new D-NNN entry links back via the `Supersedes:` field.
>
> **Append-only**: this section is enforced append-only by `check_changelog_append_only.py` (prose-only rule). Existing prose lines cannot be modified or removed. New entries are added at the end (or superseding entries are added at the end with a `Supersedes: D-MMM` field). Marker line insertions and flips above existing headings are allowed via `apply_marker.py`.

<!-- TEMPLATE ENTRY - replace with real decisions -->

<!-- STATUS: proposed -->
### D-001: Example decision title

**Context**: What forces are at play, what is being decided between. Include constraints, alternatives considered, and why a decision is needed now.

**Decision**: The chosen direction, stated in the active voice. One paragraph.

**Consequences**: What becomes easier; what becomes harder; what follow-up work is implied. Include security, performance, and operational consequences as applicable.

**Supersedes**: D-NNN (optional; only present for entries that replace a prior decision)
