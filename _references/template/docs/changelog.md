## Conventions

- **Newest first**: most recent version at the top
- **[Unreleased]** section: accumulate changes as they are merged, before cutting a release
- **Categories**: use only the 6 categories above (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- **Link to issues/PRs**: reference issue numbers where applicable
- **Version links**: at the bottom of the file, add comparison links:
  ```
  [Unreleased]: https://github.com/{{org}}/{{repo}}/compare/v{{version}}...HEAD
  [{{version}}]: https://github.com/{{org}}/{{repo}}/compare/v{{prev}}...v{{version}}
  ```

## Freshness Policy

Add entries to the [Unreleased] section as changes are merged. Move entries to a versioned section when cutting a release.
